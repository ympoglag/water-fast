title: Water Fast
---
## Why
I'm doing this because I have Long-Covid-like issues of pretty much constant
Brain Fog, Fatigue, Tinnitus, Non-Refreshing Sleep, Headaches, Neck-Pain,
Reduced-Bodily-Sensations and Anhedonia - and I've had this for 2 years now
(since I first had COVID), with worsening in the last year (where I had COVID
for a 2nd time).

I've heard that after the 4th day at least the Brain Fog supposedly is improved
for some and I hope that this would help me narrow what is trying to kill me
with the hatred of a thousand suns.

## How
- Not eating anything caloric for 5 days. But drink 3-4L of water per day.
- Stopping my daily 20mg of Vyvanse use alongside. (Attempt/Optional, might be
  too much - I'll see)
- Supplements/Meds daily:
  + ALCAR (500mg)
  + Allegra (2x 120mg)
  + Quercetin (1x)
  + Magnesium Threonate (2x, morning, night)

- I have my pulse wrist watch and I'll measure blood pressure 3x a day. When
  either get dangerously low, I'll break it (partially or fully depending on
  severity).

- For ElEcTrOlYtEs (actually an issue if you don't watch it) - I have:
  + Potassium Chloride
  + Salt
  + Magnesium

  I'll create mixes of these at some points and drink them.

### Breaking the Fast
I bought a glass of ready-made beef broth with which I plan to break the fast,
gently.

### What to do for 5 days
Light exercise (best going for a simple walk) should be good to try to fight the
depression and malaise caused by Vyvanse withdrawal and lack of food before
sleep times.

Otherwise, trying to stay positive, mix of lying down, sitting, moving and
managing limited energy with highest mood as possible by not overthinking,
acceptance, thankfulness and looking-forward.

**Summary**

- Starting to get real hungry.
- Lots and lots of headaches - energy okay (not high, but also not completely
  terrible). - Today felt like being mildly sick with the headaches to me.
- Some Vyvanse still in my system, was comparatively sharp, despite the
  headaches.
- Took a Paracetamol for the headache, ChatGPT says, Salt is better - will try
  next time.
- It's funny how your nose and eyes suddenly are insanely alert to tasty
  smells/sights.

Feeling pretty weak.

Vyvanse remains being an appetite suppressant, which means stopping it will make
me backlash hungry from not taking it alone - this will be mixed with 5 days of
water fasting.

Doing both at once is pretty fucking stupid, but I feel pressed for time and
I'll try my best - if hunger overtakes me in an unbearable way, I'll start
Vyvanse again.

The water fast has priority.

My 'bad' thoughts are naturally starting to be really loud.

Words don't appear in a 'creative' way in my head, instead, coming up with
them is a struggle right now - if I repeat myself a lot, mistype or write
half-sentences, know why that's the case and forgive me.

The point where I write the least and the most simple are the points where my
pain will likely be the biggest.

---

Nonetheless, some Vyvanse is still in my blood stream (for now) and it's
probably bound to get way, **way** worse once that's gone too.

For now, I still feel somewhat in control and feel able to practice
'thankfulness', 'forgiveness' and 'self-love' to move myself out of the pain and to break out
of rumination/worries downward spirals.

Fearing that this will change/get worse will throw me into it's hands sooner, so
I'll restrain from leaning into it as long as I can.

There is still room for control.

Let things go.

Look forward.

There will be some pleasure again and it's worth staying for.

It will be better.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do for the next 5 days.

I desperately long for someone to take the pain from me, but I know that this is unfeasible.

A dysfunctional neurochemical brain is not in tune with the world and thus can't be soothed by it.

I only have my own pain and myself.

And this journal.

### 11:07

Fuck this fucking headache, fuck this weakness, fuck this head pressure.

When I move my head hurts.

Pretty much only can lie down at the moment, but I don't want to be a passive
fucking couch potato.

Anhedonia is not too bad actually atm.

### 12:32

Felt a tad better, went outside to the pharmacy and super market.  
Starting to feel the hunger. (:

### 12:58

Getting pretty significant headaches again.

### 15:20
- Bought Allegra
- Bought Quivuiq 50mg for sleep

### 18:32

Finished a 3hr phone call and a walk through town.

Helped / Was quite doable.

I swallowed one Paracetamol today, that might've helped too.

Also 2 Allegras.

### 19:22

I'm pretty cold.  
Actually the whole day I felt very sensitive to coldness.

That seems unusual to me.

### 20:13
**BP**:
118 SYS 70 DIA 86 PUL

Rise.

**BP**:
110 SYS 64 DIA 88 PUL

### 10:50

Not feeling particularly great.

Still feeling cold very easily.

Lying down makes things easier.  
Sitting or Standing gives me headaches and weakness quickly.
