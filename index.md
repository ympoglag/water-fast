title: Water Fast
---
## Why
I'm doing this because I have Long-Covid-like issues of pretty much constant
Brain Fog, Fatigue, Tinnitus, Non-Refreshing Sleep, Headaches, Neck-Pain,
Reduced-Bodily-Sensations and Anhedonia - and I've had this for 2 years now
(since I first had COVID), with worsening in the last year (where I had COVID
for a 2nd time).

I've heard that after the 4th day at least the Brain Fog supposedly is improved
for some and I hope that this would help me narrow what is trying to kill me
with the hatred of a thousand suns.

## How
- Not eating anything caloric for 5 days. But drink 3-4L of water per day.
- Stopping my daily 20mg of Vyvanse use alongside. (Attempt/Optional, might be
  too much - I'll see)
- Initial Supplements/Meds daily:  
  (**NOTE:** I changed these after 4 days, see **[#Switch of
  Plans](#switch-of-plans)**)

  + ALCAR (500mg) - *(later dropped)*
  + Allegra (2x 120mg)
  + Quercetin (1x)
  + Magnesium Threonate (1x, night)

- I have my pulse wrist watch and I'll measure blood pressure 3x a day. When
  either get dangerously low, I'll break it (partially or fully depending on
  severity).

- For ElEcTrOlYtEs (actually an issue if you don't watch it) - I drink 3L water,
  including:

  + 2g Potassium Chloride
  + 8g Salt
  + 2g Magnesium Chloride (I got in my pharmacy *very* cheap) (= 240mg of Magnesium)  
    *Make sure to store it in a sealed glass, not a paper bag, it will melt
    otherwise, as it will pick up moisture from the surroundings.*
  + *Optional*: 40g of lime OR  
                3-5 slices of thin cucumber

  I plan to drink 250ml every 50min.

  **❗** These can be shifted according while **Monitoring Symptoms**:

  | Symptom              | Possible Cause      | Fix
  | ---                  | ---                 | ---
  | Lightheadedness      | Low sodium          | Slightly increase salt (to 9g)
  | Muscle twitch/cramps | Low Mg or K         | Ensure you’re not skipping magnesium
  | Palpitations         | Potassium imbalance | Split KCl into 3–4 doses over the day
  | Cold hands/feet      | Low sodium/glucose  | Salt usually helps, or gentle refeed


### Breaking the Fast
I bought a glass of ready-made beef broth with which I plan to break the fast,
gently (includes carbohydrates, protein, fat).

(It's < 50kcal, which actually won't break the fast (< 20kcal to not break
substantial autophagy), for that you need >100 - however beef broths do
lower/break autophagy - it wil break autophagy for up to ~8 hours).

### What to do for 5 days
Light exercise (best going for a simple walk) should be good to try to fight the
depression and malaise caused by Vyvanse withdrawal and lack of food before
sleep times.

Otherwise, trying to stay positive, mix of lying down, sitting, moving and
managing limited energy with highest mood as possible by not overthinking,
acceptance, thankfulness and looking-forward.

## 22.07.2025

**Summary**

- Starting to get real hungry.
- Lots and lots of headaches - energy okay (not high, but also not completely
  terrible). - Today felt like being mildly sick with the headaches to me.
- Some Vyvanse still in my system, was comparatively sharp, despite the
  headaches.
- Took a Paracetamol for the headache, ChatGPT says, Salt is better - will try
  next time.
- It's funny how your nose and eyes suddenly are insanely alert to tasty
  smells/sights.

### 10:22

Feeling pretty weak.

Vyvanse remains being an appetite suppressant, which means stopping it will make
me backlash hungry from not taking it alone - this will be mixed with 5 days of
water fasting.

Doing both at once is pretty fucking stupid, but I feel pressed for time and
I'll try my best - if hunger overtakes me in an unbearable way, I'll start
Vyvanse again.

The water fast has priority.

---

My 'bad' thoughts are naturally starting to be really loud.

Words don't appear in a 'creative' way in my head, instead, coming up with
them is a struggle right now - if I repeat myself a lot, mistype or write
half-sentences, know why that's the case and forgive me.

The point where I write the least and the most simple are the points where my
pain will likely be the biggest.

---

Nonetheless, some Vyvanse is still in my blood stream (for now) and it's
probably bound to get way, **way** worse once that's gone too.

For now, I still feel somewhat in control and feel able to practice
'thankfulness', 'forgiveness' and 'self-love' to move myself out of the pain and to break out
of rumination/worries downward spirals.

Fearing that this will change/get worse will throw me into it's hands sooner, so
I'll restrain from leaning into it as long as I can.

There is still room for control.

Let things go.

Look forward.

There will be some pleasure again and it's worth staying for.

It will be better.

---

I'm not sure what I'm going to do for the next 5 days.

I desperately long for someone to take the pain from me, but I know that this is unfeasible.

A dysfunctional neurochemical brain is not in tune with the world and thus can't be soothed by it.

I only have my own pain and myself.

And this journal.

### 11:07

Fuck this fucking headache, fuck this weakness, fuck this head pressure.

When I move my head hurts.

Pretty much only can lie down at the moment, but I don't want to be a passive
fucking couch potato.

Anhedonia is not too bad actually atm.

### 12:32

Felt a tad better, went outside to the pharmacy and super market.  
Starting to feel the hunger. (:

### 12:58

Getting pretty significant headaches again.

### 15:20
- Bought Allegra
- Bought Quivuiq 50mg for sleep

### 18:32

Finished a 3hr phone call and a walk through town.

Helped / Was quite doable.

I swallowed one Paracetamol today, that might've helped too.

Also 2 Allegras.

### 19:22

I'm pretty cold.  
Actually the whole day I felt very sensitive to coldness.

That seems unusual to me.

### 20:13

Fell asleep.

## 23.07.2025

**Summary**

- Felt cold easily.
- Got diarrhea after drinking too much/too high salt water.
- Surprised how "well" I was doing.
- Experienced quite some hunger and hypersensitive to food smells/looks.

### 08:32

**BP**:
110 SYS 64 DIA 88 PUL

### 10:50
**Weight**: 65.1 kg

Not feeling particularly great.

Still feeling cold very easily.

Lying down makes things easier.  
Sitting or Standing gives me headaches and weakness quickly.

### 12:27
Felt better after taking an ALCAR.

Probably took too many supplements/pills at once, because I currently have
**diarrhea**.

My stomach grumbled/grumbles before I have to run to the toilet.

The first time it rubmled I felt something like a stomach cramp, which I haven't
felt in ages.

First poops were soft'ish, from then on, only liquid poops.

Went 2 times within 10 minutes now, let's see how it progresses.

Otherwise feeling, okay.

### 12:28
**BP**:
119 SYS 66 DIA 91 PUL

I'm pretty surprised how "well" I'm doing despite not having taken any Vyvanse
for 1+ days now.

Let's see how it continues.

Headaches are still here and especially POTS-like circulation "issues" when
lying/standing up.

My pulse is still pretty high.

### 12:38
There comes the hunger.

My god the hunger!

### 13:28
Feeling better, didn't had more than 2 diarrhea poops @ 12:28 - the hunger also
is manageable.

Otherwise, feeling fairly good, also energy wise.

### 13:40
A smell from outside my window crept into my room and now I'm terribly hungry
again.

You really need to shield your senses.

I also stood up from lying down in my bed and my vision went black and I fell
back into bed. (:

### 15:00~
Starting to feel pretty decent.

### 17:35
**BP**:
119 SYS 65 DIA 93 PUL

### 01:28
Sleep

## 24.07.2025

**Summary**

- Felt okay during the day.
- Dragged myself to do a walk, which felt okay during but was exhausted after.
- Felt very very weak and hypotense at evening/night.  
  Lowest blood pressure recording so far, made me anxious, but everything ended
  up well in the end.
- In the end realized I didn't drink 3-4 Liters of Water that day (more like
  2~), which also could've explained the weakness.

### 09:49
Rise.

**Sleep**:

- **Total**: 8 h 12 min

### 11:49
**BP**:
116 SYS 65 DIA 89 PUL

Feeling weak, no headache's so far, neck is still fairly stiff (like it was
before the water fast).

So far so good.

### 15:02
**Weight**: 63.1 kg

**BP**:
121 SYS 73 DIA 90 PUL

### 17:08
Went outside for a small walk (40min).  
It was really really good, even tho I was dragging myself around somehwat.

Reminder to go outside and go for walks, even when you don't feel like it.

### 20:29
**BP**:
103 SYS 55 DIA 66 PUL

### 23:27
Sleep

Feeling really weak and hypotense.

I realized I didn't drink 3-4 Liter during the day!

This might've also been due to that.

### 00:50
**BP**:
112 SYS 59 DIA 52 PUL

### 01:35
Woke up.

Was very worried about my hypotension and felt anxious of losing consciousness.

Unlocked my front door.

Messaged friends that if I don't send something in the next 10 hours, they
should call an ambulance.

This allowed me to calm down and go back to sleep.

## 25.07.2025

**Summary**

- Felt better after waking up.
- Taking ALCAR caused some sudden genital pain, I panicked and ingested my beeth
  broth.
- Felt better thereafter, visited a friend and spent the day with him.
- Took an evening walk that was likely too much and made my following sleep worse.

### 08:07
Rise.

Feeling better than yesterday night.

**Sleep**:

- **Total**: 8 h 28 min
- **Deep Sleep**: 2 h 25 min
- **Light Sleep**: 4 h 5 min
- **REM sleep**: 1 h 48 min
- **Awake**: 2 times/12 min
- **Sleep Score**: 89/100
- *Respiratory Rate*: 8-15 brpm
- *Heart Rate*: 44-62 bpm
- *Blood oxygen*: 97-99%

### 08:30
**BP**:
110 SYS 56 DIA 77 PUL

### 09:38
Took an ALCAR while lying down and had short massive genital pain.

Sorta paniced and ingested my glass of beeth broth (which gave me ~37.4kcal) -
which is not enough to break the fast massively.

	50-100 kcal are said to likely maintain a reduced but still active autophagy state.
	100-200+ kcal are said to break autophagy.

Taking ALCAR on a water fast seems like a bad idea, depending on how susceptible
you are to genital pain (maybe).

### 09:43
**Weight**: 63.0 kg

### 09:57
Feeling better.

### 11:00~
Consumed another beef broth (bad idea).

### 13:21
Consumed some coffee (doesn't break fast or autophagy).

### 01:14
Sleep

## Switch of Plans
I have expected some results the last 2 days, but those haven't happened.

I will add 2 more days with a change in protocol, as I think I have accidentally lessened autophagy:

- Consuming the beef broth was a **bad idea** and likely broke
  autophagy for ~8 hours.  
  I confused it with 'beef bone broth' and even those need to be pure, which I
  can't buy anywhere nearby me, so autophagy safe bone broth's are no option.

  (Making them yourself requires buying and simmering beef bones for 36hours,
  which is way too long and tedious to make now, maybe next time I will make
  sume and freeze them for later usage, but as I'm currently in the weakness of
  my fast, it's not an option)

- Moving too much was a bad idea, my muscles hurt after it which implies that
  I've broke down muscle. 15-30min of light walking is enough and not
  more - I will target 15min - best done not late (last time I walked late I
  slept worse).

- Playing video games too much likely raised Cortisol and was a bad idea, I
  won't play games anymore now.

- ALCAR is a bad idea, I will not use it for the next 2 days.

- Green Tea is not only Autophagy safe, but actually helps Autophagy, I will
  drink (2-3 cups of 240 mL each, steeped lightly).

- I have finally measured a correct electrolyte water mix, see [#How](#how)

- I have finally gone through all the supplements I inteded to take and now will
  end up with the following:

  + Quercetin 500 mg/day (best taken in the morning with water)

  + Curcuma Extract 500-1000 mg/day, morning or midday, maybe with green tea (should be paired with black pepper extract (piperine))

  + Magnesium L-Threonat 500-1000 mg, evening

  + Theanine 200-400 mg, evening, sleep

  + Allegra 120mg (Antihistamine), whenever

  + Desloratadin (Antihistamine), whenever

  These should **NOT** be taken:

  + CDP Choline (technically breaks the fast due to calories)

  + Bifidobacterium bifidum (breaks the fast, use for refeeding afterwards)
